A Memo from the Director of the Binary Counting Bureau (BCB)
September 16, 2015

Hello, and congratulations on your appointment as Comptroller at the Binary Counting Bereau, where everyone is the most significant bit! Your main responsibility as Comptroller is to supervise one shift with your working group and ensure the highest level of accuracy and efficiency. Each shift lasts ________. Please read these directions carefully before beginning.

You are first required to provide or attain the following resources:
 - ____ Chairs
 - At least as many workers as you have chairs
 - A roll of tape
 - A timer

Now direct your workers arrange the chairs in a straight line and label in the following formation, beginning at the rightmost chair (if you have fewer chairs than are listed below, simply start at the right and stop once you reach your last chair)

 +-----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+
 | 128 | | 64 | | 32 | | 16 | | 8 | | 4 | | 2 | | 1 |  
 +-----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+

Now direct your workers to form a line next to the rightmost chair. You may then instruct the workers as follows:

"You will notice the chairs in front of me are labelled with numbers. Your job as workers is to sit down in the seats such that the occupied seats add up to the numbers that I count off to you. You are to occupy seats in order -- according to your spot in line -- and when you vacate your seat you must move to the end of the line."

When the shift begins, you will start by announcing the number "1". As soon as the workers form this number, you will increase the number by one and wait for them to form the next number. Continue this for the duration of the shift. Feel free to work cooperatively with your team!

You may now set your shift timer to ________ and begin the shift. 

When the shift is over, please thank your workers and fill out the attached timesheet and indicate the highest number reached. If time permits, you are encouraged to appoint a new Comptroller for the next shift.
